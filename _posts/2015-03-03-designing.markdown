Ember allows us to create solutions we couldn't come up with years ago.

# Pain in the ass user :)

Welcome to the world of making things for people.

## Mental models

Understand where the user is coming from.

So, what are they?:

* What I think a thing is.
* How I think a thing works.

Ever evolving, can be updated and changed.

What is "home"? It's more than a kitchen sink or couch. There are characteristics
like a roof, windows, door, etc. This concept evolved over time.

Types of mental models:

* Macro: From a distance, initial assessment
* Micro: How the individual interaction works
