Turmoil in the web landscape (classic underdog story). Largest app runtime
in the world. Web performance is on the rise.

Mobile apps can be built, and still a delight to use, with web tech.

> Web tools are starting to get really fucking awesome.

Ember + Polymer + Material Design = ember-flow

Remove breaks in the user experience, stepping away from the "page" metaphor.

## Web Components

Extend the browser itself, with encapsulation, and declarative markup. There
is true reusability/portability.

## Why Ember and Polymer?

World class routing and state management, while using the Web Animations API.
