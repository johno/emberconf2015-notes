Ember is growing: more apps, CLI users, addons, meetups/user groups.

#### What's new since 2014?:

* Rapid release cycle
* RFC process
* Features
  * HTMLBars (no more `bind-attr`!, block params, faster with less memory`, etc)
  * Robust Ember Inspector
  * Ember CLI!!!!
  * Testing ecosystem, query params, Ember Data rethink

#### What's coming?:

* Versioned guides! <3 (adopting Ember CLI semantics)
* Engines: Encapsulate a piece of an application with namespacing, etc.
* List View: Improvements coming
* `<angle-bracket>`, async, routable components
* Ember 2.0: The plan is the feature.
* JSON API out of the box
* First class support for pagination and filtering

Ember 2.0 release date of June 12. Same for Ember Inspector, Ember CLI, ALL THE THINGS!!!

## Ember CLI FastBoot

Ember on the server :). This is great for mobile devices and older machines. An end user will
be able to see a particular page's content before the JS executes (or those NoScript users).

#### How can we help?:

* Test beta apps
